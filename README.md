# DOI Analyzer
This ILLiad Server Addon will attempt to find a missing DOI using the CrossRef API, clean a DOI, extract an ISBN from a DOI, and find a missing ISBN from CrossRef metadata.

Be sure you input your email address in the config.xml file before using this Addon.  This email address will be associated with your use of the CrossRef API.  You do not need to register for a CrossRef account.  CrossRef uses your email address information for statistical purposes.
